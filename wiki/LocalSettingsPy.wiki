In order to run Plotter, there has to be a file named local_settings.py in the project-root-directory. 
This file can override settings from settings.py and is not under version control. 
It is used to express deploment specific information and keep passwords confidential.

Here is an example file with dummy-data:

{{{
DEBUG = True
TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG
DEVELOPMENT = True

LOCAL_MEDIA = '/path/to/sitemedia'

DATABASE_ENGINE = "sqlite3"
DATABASE_NAME = '/path/to/a/sqlite.db'

GOOGLE_API_KEY = 'your_google_api_key'

TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    '/path/to/your/plotter-working-copy/templates',
)

ADMINS = (
     ('name', 'email@example.com'),
)

MANAGERS = ADMINS
}}}
